# The Secret Order of Cyber Artificers

My name is Dazhbog and I hereby initiate you into The Secret Order of Cyber Artificers.

I created this blog/project-page for everyday cyber security analysts to write about the techincal (or non-technical) skills they learn in their everyday jobs. A lot infosec blogs usually focus on the "hot topic" hacks or industry mistakes of the day. This is useful, but oversensationalizing. I don't believe it adds any real value to our daily tasks.

So, if you learned any new Splunk query, something new during an intrusion event investigation, or perhaps you created a helpful bash script -- I invite you to share your knowledge with the rest of us! It doesn't matter how big or small you think your contribution may be, because they only way we grow individually and as an industry is if we get over the "imposter syndrome" and understand that every SOC analyst/hacker has to start from somewhere. We all work in different industries and at different levels. Therefore, any bit of knowledge will be helpful to someone, I promise.

I hope this inspired you to join our Order and help spread knowledge far and wide!
